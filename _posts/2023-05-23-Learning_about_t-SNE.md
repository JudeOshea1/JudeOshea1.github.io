#Learning about t-SNE 

Today I did some learning about another method of analysis for high-dimensional data. t-SNE (t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding) is a method of visulising high amounts of data. This method can easily be adapted to anaylising the result of a classifier as it will group together the images that are closely related. This will become super helpful in my project as I won't need to anaylsis countless lines of code, but I can just look at the t-SNE to see how closely my classifers is grouping the data. 

Here is an Example of a TSNE.
