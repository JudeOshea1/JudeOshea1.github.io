# Choosing Starting Point  
Intially I thought of writing my fastai code in Visual Studios although on futher research I decided to write my code within codespaces. I also was decideing whether to use kaggle or goggle collab. I ended up choosing Kaggle as I understood it more, although through my research I believe collab is faster. Therefore I would consider using collab if I needed a faster program
